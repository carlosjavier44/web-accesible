00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.840
24 of the panel.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.080
Happy birthday.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.680
So how did it feel to be old?

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.000
Chemistry.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.760
It is the study of change.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.600
It is growth, then decay.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.200
Then transformation.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.520
Is what?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.600
We love you, man.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.240
We love you.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.000
Everybody! The wall.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.040
You understood what I've just said to you?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.560
Is lung cancer inoperable?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.280
A substantial amount of methamphetamine
being taken off the streets.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.520
How much money is that?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.230
It's about 700 grand.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.670
It's easy money.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.790
Why don't you say the word and I'll take
you on a ride?

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.150
Watch this.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.230
Knock down the meth lab.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.710
Come on.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.630
I'm thinking if you and I could partner up.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.390
You know the business, and I know the
chemistry.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.150
You want to cook crystal meth?

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.830
Cooking is...

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.070
All.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.190
Actually, it's just basic chemistry.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.950
It's so straight.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.750
Like you just gonna break that wall.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.350
Wait, wait.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.630
Tell me why you're doing this.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.950
I am awake.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.790
There are gonna be some things that you're
comfortable about.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.990
I just want you to know that no matter
what paperwork, I have you in my heart.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.750
I run.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.590
You a little excitement in.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.070
Your life.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.430
Sometimes.
